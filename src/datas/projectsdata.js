        description: "<p className=\"project-content-infos-desc\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">What is Feminism? Each person seems to have a different relationship to feminism. Through interviews with students and passers-by at the Bürgerpark, let's try to think about the place of women in society and the term feminism itself. Feminism(s) raise important questions that can resonate in each person.</span></br></br>During my exchange semester in Bremen in Germany, I met many people from Germany and all over the world. I discovered new cultures and new ways of thinking. By confronting each other, we quickly realize that the definition of this term is much more blurry than what we think, it depends on our experience, our culture and our environment. So I thought it was the best moment to do this podcast and give people a chance to speak.</p>",
